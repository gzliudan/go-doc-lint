# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

[中文版](FAQ_cn.md) | English

## 1. Does go-doc-lint support block comments (`/* */`)?

No. The tool only checks Go doc comments that use `//` immediately above function declarations. This aligns with Go’s standard doc comment style.

## 2. Why is my function reported as a mismatch even though the comment is correct?

The tool compares the **first word** of the comment (case-sensitive) to the function name. If the first word differs or starts with a tag (e.g., `TODO:`), the match will fail.

## 3. How do I scan only test files?

Use `--test` to scan only `*_test.go` files, or `--all` to scan both production and test files.

## 4. Why does the tool skip vendor and .git directories?

These directories contain generated or external code and are excluded by default to reduce noise and improve performance.

## 5. Can I scan a single file?

Yes. Provide the file path instead of a directory:

```bash
./go-doc-lint.sh ./path/to/file.go
```

## 6. Why is the output empty but the exit code is 0?

This usually means no mismatches were found. The tool exits with 0 on success and non-zero only on errors or invalid usage.

## 7. How do I handle generated code?

Generated files often have `Code generated by` markers. Consider scanning only `cmd/`, `pkg/`, and `internal/` to avoid generated code.

## 8. What if my project is a monorepo or has multiple `go.mod` files?

Scan modules separately to reduce noise and improve clarity:

```bash
./go-doc-lint.sh .
./go-doc-lint.sh ./services/user
./go-doc-lint.sh ./libs/common
```

## 9. Does go-doc-lint support Windows?

Yes. Use `go-doc-lint.ps1` with PowerShell 5.0+ (included with Windows 10+).
